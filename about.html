Hi, I'm Blake Smith and I'm a software guy. I'm passionate about web application development and various other web technologies. If I'm writing a web app I find myself happiest when using Ruby on Rails or Django. When I have a say in the matter I like to write code in Ruby and Python, but I enjoy studying many different programming languages. Lately I've become a fan of Erlang for it's concurrent fault-tolerant goodness. I'm a free software advocate: my operating system of choice is Linux, Arch is my preferred distro, and Vim is my favorite editor.

I live and work in Chicago, IL USA. I love chess, cycling and reading. The over-arching thread that links my daily activities together is learning: I've been known to learn strange things like unicycling, skydiving and rubix-cube-fu.
