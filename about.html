<div class="span-9">
	My name is Blake Smith. I love software development. I really like web development with Ruby on Rails and Django. When I have a say in the matter I like to write code in Ruby and Python, but I enjoy studying many different programming languages. I'm a free software advocate, my operating system of choice is Linux. Arch is my distro of choice. Vim is my favorite editor.

	I live and work in Chicago, IL USA. I love chess, cycling and reading. You can follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/blakesmith">twitter</a>.
