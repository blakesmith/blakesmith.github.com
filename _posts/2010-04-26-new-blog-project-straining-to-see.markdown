Today I'm launching a new blog that I will be writing on called
[straining to see](http://sts.blakesmith.me). I've wanted a place to put
some of my more personal ideas and thoughts and it seemed like a good
idea to have a seperate space for that. I want to continue writing on
this blog when my topic is more technical and programming focused, and
more personal posts at straining to see.

What is this blog about? Here's the text from the
[about](http://sts.blakesmith.me/about) page:

Hi there, my name is Blake Smith.
<br />
<br />
In late 2009, I purchased a moleskine notebook with the need for a place
to scribble down my thoughts and ideas. What began as a general object
to contain all my day-to-day activity has turned into a stream of
thought based on my current experiences, readings and interactions. Most
of the entries represent some of the greatest questions of my heart, and
my desire to understand how I fit into this world.
<br />
<br />
As humans we have a tendency to feel that we stand alone in many areas
of our lives. I pray that through the sharing of my ideas, you will
recognize a kindred spirit and not feel as alone as you once did before.
<br />
<br />
I hope that by giving the gift of my thoughts, others may benefit by
understanding my life journey, and in doing so feel empowered on their
life journey.
