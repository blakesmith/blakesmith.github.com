Over consumption is dangerous. Some of us are better at realizing this
than others. Most of us know that eating too much food will lead to
health problems, and that watching too much TV can stunt your energy and
gentle your creativity.  We've coined phrases like 'information
overload' to describe the speed at which we receive information from the
internet, but we've failed to really complete the thought. We've gotten
so good at blindly consuming what is in front of us that we almost never
take pause and consider what it is we're ingesting. More information is
not always better, knowing more news will not always make you a better
or happier person. Why do we care so much about all this information?
Why do we care so much about news?

I've been chewing on this question a lot lately. I've been trying to
reflect on some of my own behaviors for news consumption, and why it
presents itself as such a desirous flame to fly towards. Does knowing
the latest headlines really help me in my life and allow me to be a more
whole person? Is it something I even really care about? Or am I
simply caught up in the news for other reasons?

In his book _A Million Miles in a Thousand Years_ Donald Miller talks
about our desires to tell a great story with our lives. We're all seeing
interesting stories on TV, finding them in magazines, or reading about
them in books. Stories are what inspire us, and somehow they're what
speaks very readily to our souls. We want to tell a good story with our
lives, or if we can't do that - we want to at least be a part of a great
story. We want to experience great stories as much as we can.  This is
the gap that news fills in us. It makes us feel like we're apart of a
great story. It makes us somehow feel like we're involved in the making
of this story.  By engrossing our thoughts in the news, we are fooling
our brains into the belief that it's our life story too.

But are we really a part of the story?

It all looks like cheap filler to me. I've fallen for it over and over again.
The newest gadget being released, the underdog sports team beating the top
dogs, the young hot movie star doing something scandelous. These are things
that look exciting. They seem to quench my thirst for story. In reality though,
they're like drinking alcohol. They water my tongue, make the insides of my
mouth wet, and get my head feeling good, but in the end I'm left
dehydrated. I'm not really apart of these stories. I didn't create anything,
I didn't take part in any way, and I certainly didn't make any new mark on the
world. What am I really doing for the world by following the news?

I bumped into this quote on the [37signals
blog](http://37signals.com/svn) today:

<p class="quote">
"I really feel like that combination of little, easy motor skills and
clicking combined with feeling a little less bored for a minute is
completely addictive to people. When the main way we communicate with
each other is through all these things — and I’m not saying, "Don’t use
Facebook, don’t use Twitter." What I am saying is, if you’re not mindful
about the amount of your attention that goes to thinking about and
consuming those things, you’re not going to be making good stuff, either
for that medium or elsewhere. That’s what I got kind of hung up on, when
I finally realized that all I was doing was eating and producing
potato chips all day long."

-Merlin Mann

I'm subsisting on a diet of potato chips and somehow I expect that
I'm going to produce anything but potato chips. Who am I kidding?

I defensively tell myself that if nothing else, I follow the news so I
can "Stay informed, stay up to date, _be current with the world and pop
culture_." This is complete hogwash. This a rationalization that does
more damage than it does help.

I often wonder if I keep up with the news just so I can fit in with
other people. So I can have something to talk about with people that
isn't so deep. "Hey, did you hear about the latest iPhone? Pretty cool
huh?" Who cares. It's a phone. It's something that you put into your
pocket that makes calls and does some stuff on the internet. Is it
really something I care about? Is it really something I'm passionate
about in my life? I talk about this stuff because it's easy. It
doesn't require much deep thinking to talk about gadgets. I don't have
to think about something more interesting to talk about - the latest
headlines provide all kinds of content that's easy to fall back on. I
don't have to chew on tougher ideas when I can just rattle off the
latest thing I read about online. Is this really what I want? To talk
about silly distractions that aren't that important? Would it be better
to simply say nothing at all than to talk about this mindless drivel?

What's worse, is how the news detracts from my creative nature. The
cheap soundbites are what roll around in my head rather than something
important. Rather than thinking about issues that are truly meaningful
to me, I'm told what's meaningful. I'm told what should be rattling
around in my brain, and what things I should be concerned about. My head
becomes full with garbage. I sacrifice my mental space for unimportant
matters that aren't worth thinking about. I consume so much news that my
gluttonous brain can't squeeze anything more inside. There isn't
anything more to pack in there. How can I really create awesome works of
art if I've got all this other nonsense screaming in my head? I'm
eternally worrying, rather than eternally creating. And if I'm not
growing, not creating, not adapting and changing, what am I doing?
Have I really been reduced to a mindless consumer? Is that the kind
of story I want to tell? Is this what I want written on my gravestone?

Here lies Blake Smith. He consumed a lot of stuff, chewed on whatever
was held in front of his mouth, and swallowed anything that tasted good.

Man! What an inspiring hero! I wish I could have met this Blake Smith
when he was still alive!

What I guess I'm ultimately trying to say is that I have to be
constantly mindful of what kinds of news I ingest. I have to be on
constant alert, and always asking myself if this new piece of
information will help me tell a better life story. Not just the
illusion of being a part of a story, but actually telling one, with my
actual body, with my actual life. I have to be constantly examining why
I'm drawn to it. Is it because it will really help me achieve my life
missions, or is it just so I can fit in socially with others? Is this
news really going to entertain me, or just be a way to waste time and
feel slightly less bored? Am I consuming just because it's been put in
front of me, or because I really need the substance of what it's
offering?

News is kind of like the food portion sizes in America, they've
continued to get bigger and bigger and less and less nutritious. Rather
than thinking about what's really good for us, we're naturally prone to
just continue to eat everything that's been put on our plate. We have to
be mindful of what we eat. We have to be mindful of what we read, watch,
listen to, or talk about. Because if we're not telling the stories we
want to be, we're ultimately just retelling someone else's story that
they told us to tell.
