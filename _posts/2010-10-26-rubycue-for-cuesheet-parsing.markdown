title: rubycue for cuesheet parsing
published: true

I just published a new Ruby gem to github and gemcutter for parsing
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_sheet_(computing)">cuesheets</a>. I use
cuesheets with the DJ sets that I [download from the
internet](http://cuenation.com), mostly for the [Essential
Mix](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wkfp).

If you need the ability to parse cuesheet files in Ruby, you can install
the gem from [gemcutter](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubycue). [Check out the project
page](http://github.com/blakesmith/rubycue) for more details on usage
and other updates.

Cheers and enjoy!
