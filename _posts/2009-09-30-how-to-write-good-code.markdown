The other day I was reading an article on Slashdot about so called ['Duct Tape Programmers'](http://developers.slashdot.org/story/09/09/25/1257226/The-Duct-Tape-Programmer) and [this comment](http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1382191&cid=29540129) stuck out. Behold, I give you the end-all be-all of how to write good code:
