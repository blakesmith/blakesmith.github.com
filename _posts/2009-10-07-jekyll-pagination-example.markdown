### what is jekyll?

From the jekyll website:

<p class="quote">
	"Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub."
</p>

What this means is that you can take a website that has a simple function, such as a blog or personal site - and give it easy to use dynamic properties. For example, my blog here is encapsulated entirely in static html files. I compose my pages in Markdown, HTML, or Textile - and jekyll 'compiles' them to static html for presentation.

### using with blog posts

Jekyll is losely based around the blog model. It has built-in support for managing blog posts, and pagination that goes with it. One thing that was difficult for me when getting started was finding a good example of how to use jekyll to paginate my blog posts. I didn't want every post to be listed on the front page.

The jekyll documentation [provides the following](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/template-data) variables for working with pagination:

<pre>
paginator.per_page		Number of posts per page.
paginator.posts			Posts available for that page.
paginator.total_posts		Total number of posts.
paginator.total_pages		Total number of pages.
paginator.page 			The number of the current page.
paginator.previous_page 	The number of the previous page.
paginator.next_page 		The number of the next page. 
</pre>

A somewhat spartan list for managing pagination. I tried to extrapolate how the pagination feature functions specifically. The jekyll documentation isn't much help here, but I did find this [cucumber test](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/2f2e45bedf67dedb8d1dc0d02612345ee5c893f2/features/pagination.feature) in the git repository that helped point me in the right direction. I recommend reading it to understand a bit more how the feature works.

### an example

Start by adding the following to the bottom of your \_config.yml file in the root of your jekyll project:

{% highlight yaml %}
paginate: 5
{% endhighlight %}

In our case, we want our blog posts to be split with 5 posts per page. Let's look at the code to render the paginated list.

<pre>
<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in paginator.posts %}
    <li><span class="weak">
      {{ post.date | date_to_string }}
      </span> &raquo; <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>


<!-- Pagination -->
{% if paginator.previous_page == 1 %}
	<a class="semi-weak" href="/">&laquo; fresh thoughts</a>
{% endif %}
{% if paginator.previous_page > 1 %}
	<a class="semi-weak" href="/page{{ paginator.previous_page }}">&laquo; fresh thoughts</a>
{% endif %}
{% if paginator.next_page <= paginator.total_pages %}
	<a class="semi-weak" href="/page{{ paginator.next_page }}">stale thoughts &raquo;</a>
{% endif %}
</pre>
