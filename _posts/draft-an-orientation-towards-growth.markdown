Among the important words that I choose to as the mantra to my life, I would deem the word _growth_ as one of the closest to the top. Living in a state of constant growth keeps me with my eyes on the horizon. It teaches me to be thankful for today, but also excited that tomorrow can bring something completely new and unexpected to my life. If I'm not making a conscious decision to grow in my relationships, spirituality, work and skills, I'm making a conscious decision to atrophy. Here are just a few things I try to stay fixed on when pursuing a life of growth:

## Constantly remind myself to step outside my comfort zone

Stepping up to the plate when I have the chance to do something out of my comfort zone is what I strive for. When I start to get those butterflies is when I have to stop and examine my head. Do I take the risk and gain a growing experience? Or do I sit on the sidelines, retreat into my place of comfort and always wonder whether going the road less traveled would have gotten me to some place better? Upward progress is something that only happens effectively when I'm stepping out into the void. Like a tree stretching its branches upwards, I have to keep reaching into new sky. Falling back onto things I'm comortable with may feel safe and secure, but it's no way for me to explore the mysterious unknowns. I don't ever want to be a person who 'settles' for what's easy.  

## Surround myself with other growth-oriented people

## Admit that I don't know everything

## Be intentional about rest
